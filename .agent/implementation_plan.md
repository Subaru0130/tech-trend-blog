# Implementation Plan - Content Generation Logic Improvement

The goal is to ensure future articles generated by `npm run generate` automatically follow the "mybest" style guidelines and select products popular in the Japanese market with accessible images.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This change affects the **automated generation** of new articles. It does not change existing articles.

## Proposed Changes

### Scripts
#### [MODIFY] [generate-post.mjs](file:///c:/Users/Kokik/OneDrive/gemini/tech-trend-blog/scripts/generate-post.mjs)
- Update the `prompt` in `generateArticle` function.
- **New Instructions**:
    - **Market Focus**: Explicitly state "Focus on the Japanese market (2024-2025 trends)".
    - **Product Selection**: "Select top-selling products in Japan that are **AVAILABLE ON AMAZON.CO.JP**."
    - **Exclusion Rule**: "Do NOT include products that are not sold on Amazon (e.g., some specific Dyson models or carrier-exclusive phones) because we need to fetch images from Amazon."
    - **Image Strategy**: "Prioritize products with high-quality main images on Amazon."
    - **Component Props**:
        - `ratings`: Require specific criteria keys (e.g., "Cost", "Performance").
        - `price`: Require realistic JPY prices.
        - `affiliateLinks`: Enforce `SEARCH:Product Name` format.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Run `npm run generate` to generate a new article (e.g., for "Hair Dryer" or "Frying Pan").
- Check the generated MDX file:
    - Does it list Japanese popular products?
    - Are the `RankingCard` props correct?
    - Is the tone correct?
