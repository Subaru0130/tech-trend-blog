## In-Depth Analysis

### 1. Design & Display

The iPad Air and 11-inch iPad Pro share a similar modern design with slim bezels and an all-screen display. The iPad Air features a vibrant Liquid Retina display, while the iPad Pro boasts a Liquid Retina XDR display with ProMotion technology. ProMotion allows for adaptive refresh rates up to 120Hz, resulting in smoother scrolling and responsiveness. The Pro also gets significantly brighter thanks to mini-LED backlighting. Design-wise, they are almost identical, with minor thickness differences.

### 2. Performance & Battery

The iPad Air is powered by the Apple M1 chip, offering a significant performance boost over previous generations. The iPad Pro takes it a step further with the Apple M2 chip, providing even faster CPU and GPU performance. This difference is noticeable in demanding tasks like video editing, gaming, and 3D rendering. Both iPads offer excellent battery life, typically lasting a full day of moderate use. According to benchmarks [Source 1], the iPad Pro consistently outperformed the Air in graphics-intensive tasks, but the Air remains very capable for everyday use.

### 3. Camera

Both iPads feature a 12MP Ultra Wide front camera with Center Stage, which automatically adjusts the frame to keep you in view during video calls.
